/**
 * Creates a buffered message from an InputStream. The message can be consumed in chunks using the read() API or it may
 * be buffered and accessed in its entirety by waiting for the promise to resolve.
 *
 * Other implementations may extend this class to add custom properties such as a `isBinary()` flag for WebSocket
 * messages.
 *
 * Buffering Example:
 *
 * $stream = new Message($inputStream);
 * $content = yield $stream;
 *
 * Streaming Example:
 *
 * $stream = new Message($inputStream);
 *
 * while (($chunk = yield $stream->read()) !== null) {
 *     // Immediately use $chunk, reducing memory consumption since the entire message is never buffered.
 * }
 *
 * @deprecated Use Amp\ByteStream\Payload instead.
